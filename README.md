## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd jobscooter
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Your MySQL database is already created: `jobscootercoz614_jobscooter`
2. Run the MySQL schema file to create tables:
   - Open phpMyAdmin
   - Select your database: `jobscootercoz614_jobscooter`
   - Go to "SQL" tab
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema_mysql.sql`
   - Click "Go" to execute

### 3. Environment Configuration
Your `.env` file is already created with your database credentials. You may want to update:

```env
# Email Configuration (when ready)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Security (change in production)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production_2024
ENCRYPTION_KEY=change_this_to_32_char_key_prod_2024
```

### 4. Create Upload Directories
```bash
mkdir -p uploads/documents uploads/images uploads/videos
```

### 5. Start the Server
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
